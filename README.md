# 🚀 apps-redux: Learn Redux Toolkit with Next.js

Welcome to **apps-redux**, a learning-focused project that demonstrates how to effectively use Redux Toolkit in a Next.js application. This repository provides **three practical examples** to guide you through different Redux Toolkit use cases:

1. **Counter** 🧮  
   A simple counter to grasp the basics of Redux Toolkit.

2. **Shopping Cart** 🛒  
   A dynamic shopping cart system to explore advanced state management.

3. **Multi-Step Form** 📋  
   A multi-step form to learn how to handle complex state workflows.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goal of **apps-redux** is to provide a hands-on introduction to using **Redux Toolkit** in a modern Next.js application. You'll learn how to:  
- Manage application state using Redux Toolkit.  
- Integrate **Next.js** with Redux for server-side rendering (SSR).  
- Use **TypeScript** to ensure type safety.  
- Fetch and manage external data with **Axios** and **dummyjson**.  
- Style your app using **Bootstrap**.
